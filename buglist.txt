List of functions and whether or not they work:
  1. Constructor works.
  2. isEmpty() works.
  3. enqueue(const int& newEntry) does NOT work.
  4. dequeue() works.
  5. peekFront() works.
  6. Destructor does NOT work.

Explanation of Bugs:
  1. Destructor: The bug with the destrcutor was found using the valgrind command.
     Creating a Queue creates memory leaks.
  2. Enqueue: The bug with enqueue is that it adds new entries to the front of
     the Queue and not the back. This conclusion comes from multiple tests, but
     enqueue test 5 provides a clear example. The test enqueues the values 5 and
     10 onto the Queue (in that order). Then it dequeues one value. The expected
     final value is 10, but the actual final value is 5. This means that either
     enqueue added to the front or dequeue removed from the back (since peekFront
     test 3 shows that peeking at one value returns the correct value). However,
     enqueue test 5 also enqueues the values 5 and 10 onto the Queue (in that order),
     but does not use dequeue. Thus, peeking should return the value 5. However,
     the value 10 is returned. This means that enqueue added to the front.
